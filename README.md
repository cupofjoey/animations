# Swift Animations
Working on Splitting Gifs into multiple images, and writing code to run the string of multiple images into animated images
* Trying to work on animation within Swift. I'm releasing some stick packs soon, so I want to use *UIImage* and *ImageView* 
in that endeavour to make some great and funny stickers people can use in iMessage. 
* This is really just a start, and you can only advance the images via the Button I placed, but I'm going to be writing a loop so 
the images will run together with just one button press. 
More to come...
